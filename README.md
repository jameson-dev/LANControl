## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Linux server (recommended for full scanning capabilities)
- Root/sudo access for network scanning (see setup instructions)

## Installation

### Quick Installation (Recommended)

**Automated setup with one command:**

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

This will automatically:
- Set up virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Initialize database
- Create admin user
- Configure network settings
- Grant network permissions

**Then install as a system service (auto-start on boot):**

```bash
chmod +x setup-service.sh && ./setup-service.sh
```

For detailed installation instructions, see **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LANControl.git
   cd LANControl
   ```

2. **Run installation script** OR **follow manual steps in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**

## Usage

### If Installed as Service

```bash
# Start
sudo systemctl start lancontrol

# Stop
sudo systemctl stop lancontrol

# Restart
sudo systemctl restart lancontrol

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u lancontrol -f
```

### If Running Manually

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python run.py
```

The application will start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` by default.

### Configuration

You can configure the application using environment variables:

- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask secret key for sessions (auto-generated if not set)
- `BIND_HOST` - Host to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `BIND_PORT` - Port to bind to (default: 5000)

Example:

```bash
export BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0
export BIND_PORT=8080
python run.py
```

### First Time Setup

1. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser
2. Log in with the credentials you created
3. Go to Settings and configure your network scan range
4. Click "Scan Network" to discover devices

## Features Guide

### Network Scanning

The application scans your network to discover devices:

1. **Manual Scan** - Click "Scan Network" button on dashboard
2. **Automatic Scan** - Configure interval in Settings (default: 5 minutes)
3. **Scan Range** - Set your network CIDR in Settings (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`)

### Wake-on-LAN

To use WOL, devices must:
- Have WOL enabled in BIOS/UEFI
- Have WOL enabled in network adapter settings
- Be connected via Ethernet (most WiFi devices don't support WOL)

Click the "Wake" button next to any device to send a magic packet.

### Device Organization

**Nicknames**: Give devices friendly names like "Living Room TV" or "Gaming PC"

**Groups**: Organize devices by location or type:
- Living Room
- Bedroom
- Office
- IoT Devices
- etc.

**Favorites**: Star frequently accessed devices for quick access

### Search & Filter

- **Search Bar** - Search by IP, hostname, MAC, nickname, or vendor
- **Group Filter** - Show only devices in a specific group
- **Status Filter** - Show only online, offline, or unknown devices
- **Favorites Toggle** - Show only favorite devices

### Settings

**Scan Range**: Network range to scan (CIDR notation)
- Example: `192.168.1.0/24` scans 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254

**Scan Interval**: How often to automatically scan (60-3600 seconds)
- Recommended: 300 seconds (5 minutes)

**Auto Scan**: Enable/disable automatic scanning

**History Retention**: How long to keep device history (1-365 days)

### Export

Export your device inventory to:
- **JSON** - Structured data with all fields
- **CSV** - Spreadsheet-compatible format

## Cloudflare Tunnel Setup

To access LANControl remotely via Cloudflare Tunnel:

1. Install cloudflared on your server
2. Create a tunnel pointing to `localhost:5000`
3. Configure your domain in Cloudflare
4. Access securely from anywhere

LANControl's authentication will still protect your application.

## Troubleshooting

### Network Scanning Not Working

**Linux**:
- Ensure Python has `CAP_NET_RAW` capability
- Try running with sudo temporarily to test
- Check firewall rules

**Windows**:
- Run as Administrator
- Ensure Windows Firewall allows the application
- Some antivirus software may block network scanning

### Devices Not Discovered

- Verify scan range matches your network
- Some devices have firewalls that block ARP/ping
- Try adding devices manually
- Check if devices are actually on the network

### Wake-on-LAN Not Working

- Verify WOL is enabled in device BIOS
- Check network adapter WOL settings
- Ensure device is connected via Ethernet
- Some switches/routers block WOL packets
- Try waking from another device on the same network

### Permission Denied Errors

- On Linux, ensure proper capabilities are set
- Check file permissions in the `data/` directory
- Ensure write access to database file

### Running in Development Mode

The application runs in debug mode by default when using `python run.py`.

### Database Schema

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed database schema documentation.

## Security Considerations

### For Home Use

- Default binding to localhost only (127.0.0.1)
- Use strong passwords
- Change default secret key in production
- Consider HTTPS via reverse proxy
- Regular password changes recommended

### Network Access

To allow access from other devices on your network:

```bash
export BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0
python run.py
```

**Warning**: This makes the application accessible to anyone on your network.

### Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)

For external access, use Cloudflare Tunnel instead of port forwarding:
- Automatic HTTPS
- No open ports
- DDoS protection
- Zero Trust security
